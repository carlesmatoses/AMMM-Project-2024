## Generating instances
```
cd InstanceGeneratorCustom
python Main.py <config relative path>
```

## Heuristics
1. python Main.py path/to/configFile.dat (tick)
2. Arguments to python classes (tick)
3. configFile.dat to python classes stored in config (tick)
4. validate the config is correct (cross)
   1. We can improve the validation for things like the matrix. I think is a waste of time since data is generated by us.
5. instantiate main process (tick)
6. run main process (cross)
   1. Generate Instance (cross)
      1. instantiate Solution (cross)
         1. Input parametters (tick)
         2. functions for feasability and modifying the result (in progress)
